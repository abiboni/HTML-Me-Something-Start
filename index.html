            <p>Now, you may be wondering. Bluey? Isn't that a kid's show? Well, I'm here to tell you that Bluey is also for adults! Bluey is a animated show on Disney that teaches kids life lessons while also relating to adults.</p>

            <!--ADD IMAGE-->
                  <p>When you become a parent, you welcome this type of chaotic dynamic in your life. It becomes very difficult to have time for yourself. When I watch Bluey with my daughter, I feel like we're bonding about the show and all of the characters.</p>
               
               <h3><li>Gives me a new perspective on life and parenting</li> </h3>
               <!--ADD IMAGE-->
                  <p>This show caters to adults by shedding light on some obstacles you could face in life. For example, one of my favorites come from a lesson where Bluey goes camping and meets a foreign friend, Jean Luc. They have so much fun being friends for short time even without sharing the same language. During their adventures, they planted a seed together in their campsite. When Jean Luc had to go back home, Bluey is left to wonder what happened to her new friend. Her mother tells her that sometimes you meet the most special people in your life and there's a time where they have to go. Even if they have to go, you should remember that when they were around, those times were good. In the end, older Bluey is seen reading under the now tree that grew from their seed and Jean Luc returns to greet Bluey. If you're crying... Don't worry. I did too.  </p>
